> Formula One is one of the most popular and prestigious motorsports in the world, with races held in different countries around the globe.
> The 2022 F1 World Championship season ended as the most-viewed ever on American television, hitting 1.21 million 
viewers per race across ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC. Its previous record, 949,000 views per race, was set in 2021.
> I can also say that Formula 1 is especially popular with sponsors due to the race schedule being global. 
Brands looking to tap either global or regional, audiences can see their names attached to liveries on the cars 
for the season or particular races. With the popularity increasing in America, more brands are attaching themselves 
there
> Driver's performance plays a critical role in contract negotiations. There are two main factors to be considered: how a driver's performance in the previous season influences their contract extension for the next year, and whether training and retaining the same drivers for longer periods of time with the same team provides any advantage in the constructor's championship.
> There are various factors that affect a driver's contract extension, including their on-track performance, consistency, adaptability, experience, and ability to work with their team.


## Project/Goals
> The purpose of the project is to obtain the performance analysis of Formula 1 drivers. 
And for this I used various data sets from Kaggle. I have created vizualization by using Tableau. 

## Process
### Analyzing what information I need to do analysis
> 1. First Step was to identify key performance metrics which have reflects on different aspects of a driver's performance.
> 2. I have identified for myself that Qualifying position, Race results, Fastest laps, Points earned are key performance metrics I need to work with. 

### Data required for the Analysis
> 1. I did research in Internet and found some good Data Sets in Kaggle. I browsed the files by using Excel. 
> 2. I looked at the data and tried to understand "What kind of data it is?". visually, tried
to understand where data is missing or wrong. 
> 3. I started cleaning process.
> 4. Uploaded Data Sets to Tablue for vor creation of vizualization and analyzing the Data

## Results
> 1. I have created scatter plot and filtered top 5 Winning Teams Over the Years, which are 
Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren, Red Bull & Williams. It is identified by total # of points earned by drivers and 
total # of points earned by constructors. For easy use and identification, I created interactive dashbord where 
you can point at any team and it shows you how many podiums this team has over the years and which drivers 
played significant role in it. 
> 2. Identified the drivers with Maximum Podiums from 1950 to 2023. Also identified the drivers with maximum 
number of Pole positions (Race Wins). The result shows that significant role of teams' dominance played some 
Legendary drivers like Michael Schumacher, Niki Lauda, Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel, Kimi Raikkonen, 
Fernando Alonso, and of course current champion Max Verstappen. 
> 3. Visualized the graphs which shows overall statistic of qualifying positions, and it has direct correlation 
with race wins. 
> 4. The above results shows that consistency is a critical aspect for Formula 1 driversâ€™ performance. 
> 5. I have examined data of the last 4 seasons (2019 - 2023) and we can clearly see dominance of the Red Bull team. 
With each year we can see that results of Red Bull are getting stronger, thats why I can assume that the next season (2025) would also be dominated by Red Bull team. 


## Challenges 
> The challenge was that no proper instruction on the project were given and you need to identify what sides of the topic you need to examine. 
> Another issue was to find good Data for the Project. 


## Future Goals
> Since I spent a lot of time on identifying the Project subject and searching appropriate Data, I didn't have time
to do Data scraping by using Python. In my opinion it would be ideal option if I could extract latest Data myself
and do proper Data Cleaning.
